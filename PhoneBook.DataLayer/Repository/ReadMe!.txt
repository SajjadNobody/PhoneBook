This folder include all our Repository interface. 
When we want to add another model and use it in our Controllers, we will add interface like this.

Also we have generic repository. we make such things when we tired for Writing repetitive Code. 
So we make generic repository to Avoid writing repetitive codes!
every interface here should have inheritance to generic repository.
if we want to add something else we are free to do it.
we just add inheritance for having all methods in generic repository.

Remember these are just interface not real mehod! we just add methods when we want to have them in services folder.

for example: See IUserRepository  :-)
